#Ex 1: Create 2 vectors A and B, where A is (1,2,3) and B is (4,5,6). 
#With these vectors, use the cbind() or rbind() function to create a 2 by 3 matrix from the vectors. 
#You'll need to figure out which of these binding functions is the correct choice.
A <- c(1,2,3)
B <- c(4,5,6)
rbind(A,B)

#Ex 2: Create a 3 by 3 matrix consisting of the numbers 1-9.
#Create this matrix using the shortcut 1:9 and by specifying the nrow argument in the matrix() function call. 
#Assign this matrix to the variable mat
mat <- matrix(c(1:9), nrow=3)
mat

#Ex 3: Confirm that mat is a matrix using is.matrix()
is.matrix(mat)

#Ex 4: Create a 5 by 5 matrix consisting of the numbers 1-25 and assign it to the variable mat2. 
#The top row should be the numbers 1-5.
mat2 <- matrix(c(1:25), nrow = 5, byrow = TRUE)
mat2

#Ex 5: Using indexing notation, grab a sub-section of mat2 from the previous exercise that looks like this:
#[7,8]
#[12,13]
mat2[2:3,2:3]

#Ex 6: Using indexing notation, grab a sub-section of mat2 from the previous exercise that looks like this:
#[19,20]
#[24,25]
mat2[4:5, 4:5]

#Ex 7: What is the sum of all the elements in mat2?
sum(mat2)

#Ex 8: Ok time for our last exercise! 
#Find out how to use runif() to create a 4 by 5 matrix consisting of 20 random numbers (4*5=20).
mat3 <- matrix(runif(20), nrow = 4)
mat3
